Working on real time data 
  1) Extracted data from IEMOCAP dataset which was raw data 
  2) 5 folders had diffrent raw data in it{transcription s1 to s5}
  3) Converted those folders into 5 excelsheets having 2 columns { dc.ipynb }
      1] 1st column have text 
      2] 2nd column have labels
      3] here labels were not given in dataset hence it was given by model
  4) Combined all excel sheets into 1 csv { Ccsv.ipynb }
  5) to add more accurate labels { cds.ipynb }
      1] we created a model using library 
      2] created new csv file containing 1 extra column of correct labels
  6) EDA of this new dataset { EDAcds.ipynb }      
  7) after EDA we finalize dataset{ output.csv }
  8) final model { finalcol.ipynb }
